# RoyalMonad

All hail the Royal Monad!

Introducing his majesty the Royal Monad.

Royal Monads (or relative polymonads) generalize monads, polymonads _and_ relative monads.

Therefore Royal Monads (capitalize to emphasise royalness) are the king of monads! 

The ultimate abstraction! 

Ditch your boring old relative, poly or ordinary monad, and start programming with the king of monads! 

Bow before the ultimate generality of the Royal Monad!
