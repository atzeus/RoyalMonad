# RoyalMonad
Royal monads (or relative polymonads) generalize polymonads _and_ relative monads.

Therefore royal are the king of monads! The ultimate abstraction! 
Ditch your boring old (relative) (poly) monad, and start programming
with the king of monads! 

Bow before the ultimate generality of the Royal Monad, infidels!
